## Abstract
The 21st century has seen rapid urbanization and technological advancements, leading to the emergence of Smart Cities. These cities rely on data-driven solutions to improve urban living. 

This master's thesis explores the use of Deep Learning techniques on Open Data to develop an advanced air quality monitoring system for Smart Cities. The research starts by introducing Smart Cities, defining them, and providing real-world examples to illustrate their practical implementation. 
Additionally, it examines the role of Open Data in Smart Cities, emphasizing its international collaboration aspects and showcasing applications. The thesis focuses on pollution monitoring in Smart Cities, identifying the main pollutants in urban environments and introducing the Air Quality Index (AQI) as a key metric. 

A case study of Beijing exemplifies the challenges and opportunities in managing air quality within a densely populated metropolitan area. 
A review of previous works on air pollutant forecasting establishes the foundation for the research methodology. 
The investigation then focuses on examining datasets, with an emphasis on data availability, and conducting exploratory and in-depth analyses. This phase establishes the foundation for subsequent stages, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the data landscape. 

The thesis proceeds to detail the development of predictive models, covering data preparation, feature engineering, selection, scaling, and augmentation. A series of experiments were conducted to optimize the performance of the models for air quality prediction. 
The core of the research focuses on presenting and analyzing the developed model architectures, together with the results obtained. 
This section outlines the details of the models used for air quality prediction, including their design principles and capabilities. The thesis concludes with insights gained from the study and recommendations for future research. â€‹
